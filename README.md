# revservices - Custom Luau service handler

## About
revservices (acronym: revolume's service server) - is a custom service handler which also has few other functions really useful to accelerate your workflow when scripting.

as of 11th July 2022, this can:
    - serve as a GetService replacement (wave goodbye to the misery of typing game:GetService every time you want to get to Lighting!)
    - serve as a tweening handler
    - serve as a property editor, easily usable in localscripts and serverscripts
    - serve as a RunService loop maker featuring 4 different RunService loop options in a one classy function!
and of course, it provides pre-defined shortcuts to most used services.

I am not responsible if this gets used in exploiting scripts, I only provide a simpler way to use stuff.
If you want, you can fork this project and write your own features to it, or modify it - all up to the editor's wish, 
however I'd love it if you'd credit me for making revservices. That'll be awesome!

## Installation
If you're a game developer on Roblox - simply go to "source.lua", copy the code, then make a ModuleScript in the destination you want to put it in (and is reachable through scripts in Roblox Studio), and then replace the default ModuleScript code with this one, by pressing Ctrl+A, and then Ctrl+V.

If you're a script developer making script hubs or scripts for games, simply loadstring raw "source.lua" link or fork it and edit what you want in it, and then loadstring it or do other stuff with it. It's all up to your imagination!

## Credits, responsibilities and licenses
I (revolume) am the original creator of revservices, and revservices is on `CC BY` license - meaning that it can be used for commercial purposes and so on, as long as you credit the creator.
I am not responsible if this script gets used in malicious scripts/exploits, or in a huge Roblox game on the front page. I only provide the handler - and what the user does with it, is up to them.

And that's about it - happy scripting!
